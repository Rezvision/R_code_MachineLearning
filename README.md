# Machine Learning Implementation in R

This repository contains a machine learning implementation in R. It explores various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes.
## Description

The project covers the following topics:
- Implementation of Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes algorithms
- Optimization of the Random Forest model through pruning and feature reduction
- Data cleaning techniques including making column names more readable, one-hot encoding for multi-category features, removal of low-value features, and normalization of values
- Cluster analysis using K-means algorithm
- Evaluation of optimal clusters using silhouette score, elbow criterion, D index, Hubert's Index, and Dunn index
- Visualization of cluster evaluation metrics and hierarchical analysis
